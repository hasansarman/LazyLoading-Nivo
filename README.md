LazyLoading-Nivo
================

How about using thousands of image in nivo without slowing down your page?


i m really really bored of seeing useless lazy load example scripts. 
As most of you already know nowadays all browsers download all image links .. etc w
hen the page loads so.. hiding your images inside different tags and changing 
loc and src via javascript or jquery is totally useless.

This script uses AJAX and php to lazy load  images from Db or any folder.

its very simple to use just put your images inside images folder and you are done.

i m putting file names and url's inside Session variable and then i m loading these with ajax.Simple but Effective :P
